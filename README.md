## How to add it to my project?

This is a header only library. So actually, all you need is to add the libcpp-html-to-md.hpp file
in src folder to your project and start using it with #include.

But this library is uses libxml2 under the hood. So, you also need to add libxml2 to
your project before to use it.

You can find usage examples in the examples folder, also find a sample CMakeLists.txt file content below.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(myProject)

find_package(libxml2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(myProject main.cpp libcpp-html-to-md.hpp)

target_include_directories(myProject PRIVATE ${LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR})
target_link_libraries(myProject PRIVATE ${LIBXML2_LIBRARIES})

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to run the library on Windows, the Iconv library is also needed. The CMakeLists.txt file under the examples
> folder contains the necessary additions to work on both platforms.


## How to use? (Simplest Form)

You can call the **"convert"** method of the **"MarkdownConverter"** class to convert the HTML content you have  
as a string variable to Markdown format without any customization.

```cpp
#include "libcpp-html-to-md.hpp"

using namespace lklibs;

int main() {

    const auto htmlContent = R"(
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Test</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Simple H1 Header</h1>
            <p>Simple Paragraph</p>
            <h2>Another H2 Header</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
            </ol>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
                    <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
                    <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </body>
    </html>
    )";
    
    MarkdownConverter mdConverter(htmlContent);

    const auto markdownContent = mdConverter.convert();

    std::cout << markdownContent << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Semantic Versioning

Versioning of the library is done using conventional semantic versioning. Accordingly,
in the versioning made as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**;

**PATCH:** Includes possible Bug&Fixes and improvements. You definitely want to get this.

**MINOR:** Additional functionality added via backwards compatibility. You probably want to
get this, it doesn't hurt.

**MAJOR:** Additional functionality that breaks backwards compatibility. You'll need to know
what's changed before you get it, and you'll probably have to make changes to your own code.
If I publish something like this, I will definitely add the changes required for migration
section to the documentation.

## Full function list

You can find the complete list of functions in the library below.
